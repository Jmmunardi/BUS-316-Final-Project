# BUS-316-Final-Project
Walmart BUS 316 Final Project

The Walmart 316 final project.ipynb file is the main ipynb file, which contains some graphs for my explorary data analysis. For the first part, I started with the Logsitic Regression model and SVM Classifier to help me determine which model yielded better accuracy with high accuracy score, along with good precion and recall score. For the 2nd part of this project, I used models like Decision Tree Classifier, Linear Regression, and KNN Regressor to find out which model yielded the best fit for the predicitons.

Along with this ipynb file, I have also added a brief 1 page summary highlighting some of the objective that I achieved, data descrption, coding process, what I have learned from this project and also some of the changes that I would make to improve the models.
